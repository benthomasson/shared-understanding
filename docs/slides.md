## Slide 2: The Problem We All Know

**Meetings Feel Productive... But Are They?**

- Everyone nods, contributes ideas, feels progress
- Two weeks later: people building different solutions
- Why? They understood the problem differently

*"We have a meeting problem disguised as an understanding problem"*

## Slide 3: The Cognitive Science Behind It

**Why This Happens: System 1 vs System 2**

| System 1 (Fast) | System 2 (Slow) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Pattern recognition | Deliberate analysis |
| Feels like understanding | Actual understanding |
| Dominates meetings | Rarely engaged |
| | *Based on Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow"* |

## Slide 4: AI Has Similar Problems

**AI Limitations Mirror Human Ones**

| Human Limitation | AI Limitation |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Short-term memory | No persistent memory |
| Pattern recognition bias | Temporal confusion |
| Context switching cost | Loses prior context |
| | *Neither can solve complex problems alone* |

## Slide 5: The Solution - Shared Understanding Framework

**Treat AI as an Active Stakeholder**

A git-based collaborative intelligence approach:

1. **Pre-meeting**: Import Jira context
2. **During**: Human discussion (auto-transcribed)
3. **Post-meeting**: AI-human dialogue on transcript
4. **Discovery**: Systematic search across platforms
5. **Document**: Chronological markdown entries
6. **Share**: Export to Google Docs for org feedback
7. **Persist**: Archive conversations to git

## Slide 6: The Technology Stack

**Zero-Installation Tools via uvx**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **jirahhh** | Jira integration |
| **gcmd** | Google Drive export |
| **slacker** | Slack search & reminders |
| **claude-projects** | Conversation archival |
| **Git repo** | Version control & collaboration |
| **entries/** | Chronological: `YYYY/MM/DD/` |
| **Markdown** | Universal memory format |

## Slide 7: The Magic - Information Discovery

**What Systematic Search Reveals**

- Related issues nobody remembered
- Previous decisions that inform current ones
- Technical discussions buried in Slack
- Architectural diagrams and visual context

*"Slack search is incredibly good - it finds relevant conversations I'd completely forgotten"*

## Slide 8: Real Results

**A Project That Changed Everything**

After multiple cycles of the framework:

| Original Approach | Emergent Solution |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| More implementation work | Less work required |
| Standard architecture | Superior design |
| Complex for users | Easier to use |
| | *Systematic collaboration produced what neither could alone* |

## Slide 9: Compound Understanding

**How Breakthrough Solutions Emerge**

```
Cycle 1: Initial understanding
    ↓
Cycle 2: + AI synthesis + Slack discoveries
    ↓
Cycle 3: + Visual analysis + Pattern recognition
    ↓
Cycle 4: + Organizational feedback
    ↓
Emergent Solution: Better than any original proposal
```

*Each cycle builds on previous understanding*

## Slide 10: Getting Started

**Week 1:** Setup skills (Jira, Google Drive, Slack)
**Week 2:** Try on a real issue
**Week 3+:** Scale to team, iterate

**Key Practices:**
- Don't just summarize - dialogue with AI
- Probe understanding, correct errors
- Never skip the systematic search phase
- Fork the repo, clear examples, start fresh

## Slide 11: The Key Insight

**Writing Things Down Isn't Just Good Practice**

*It's cognitive enhancement for both human and artificial intelligence*

The framework works because it solves fundamental computational problems:
- Memory limitations
- Temporal confusion  
- Pattern recognition bias

**When you design systems that address these limitations, breakthrough solutions emerge naturally.**
