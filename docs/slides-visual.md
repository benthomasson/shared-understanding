## The Problem

Meetings Feel Productive... But Are They?

- Everyone nods, contributes ideas, feels progress
- Two weeks later: people building different solutions
- Why? They understood the problem differently

"We have a meeting problem disguised as an understanding problem"

## The Cognitive Science

Why This Happens: System 1 vs System 2 (Kahneman)

System 1 (Fast):
- Pattern recognition
- Feels like understanding
- Dominates meetings

System 2 (Slow):
- Deliberate analysis
- Actual understanding
- Rarely engaged

## AI Has Similar Problems

AI Limitations Mirror Human Ones:

| Human | AI |
|-------|-----|
| Short-term memory | No persistent memory |
| Pattern recognition bias | Temporal confusion |
| Context switching cost | Loses prior context |

Neither can solve complex problems alone.

Treat AI as an Active Stakeholder

A git-based collaborative intelligence approach:

1. Pre-meeting: Import Jira context
2. During: Human discussion (auto-transcribed)
3. Post-meeting: AI-human dialogue on transcript
4. Discovery: Systematic search across platforms
5. Document: Chronological markdown entries
6. Share: Export to Google Docs for org feedback
7. Persist: Archive conversations to git

Zero-Installation Tools via uvx:

- jirahhh: Jira integration
- gcmd: Google Drive export
- slacker: Slack search & reminders
- claude-projects: Conversation archival

Core Infrastructure:
- Git repository for version control & collaboration
- Chronological entries: YYYY/MM/DD/
- Markdown as universal memory format

## Information Discovery

What Systematic Search Reveals:

- Related issues nobody remembered
- Previous decisions that inform current ones
- Technical discussions buried in Slack
- Architectural diagrams and visual context

"Slack search is incredibly good - it finds relevant conversations I'd completely forgotten"

A Project That Changed Everything

After multiple cycles of the framework:

| Original | Emergent Solution |
|----------|-------------------|
| More implementation work | Less work required |
| Standard architecture | Superior design |
| Complex for users | Easier to use |

Systematic collaboration produced what neither could alone.

## Compound Understanding

How Breakthrough Solutions Emerge:

Cycle 1: Initial understanding
Cycle 2: + AI synthesis + Slack discoveries
Cycle 3: + Visual analysis + Pattern recognition
Cycle 4: + Organizational feedback

Emergent Solution: Better than any original proposal

Each cycle builds on previous understanding.

## Getting Started

::: notes

Week 1: Setup skills (Jira, Google Drive, Slack)
Week 2: Try on a real issue
Week 3+: Scale to team, iterate

Key Practices:
- Don't just summarize - dialogue with AI
- Probe understanding, correct errors
- Never skip the systematic search phase
- Fork the repo, clear examples, start fresh

Writing Things Down Isn't Just Good Practice

It's cognitive enhancement for both human and artificial intelligence.

The framework works because it solves fundamental computational problems:
- Memory limitations
- Temporal confusion
- Pattern recognition bias

When you design systems that address these limitations, breakthrough solutions emerge naturally.
